20160421
	* Add entries for quagga and redis to avoid forcing people to set their UIDs/GIDs 
	  manually.

20131113
	* Bugfix:  prior match wasn't implemented well.  That's now fixed.

20131103
	* Bugfix: PREFIX got hardcoded to /sw accidentally.
	* Bugfix: try to make sure that we're not grep'ing in the comments or matching
	  other than full names in passwd-fink and group-fink.

20130111:
	* Be kinder to folks who had been manually setting configurations via 
	  %p/etc/passwd-fink and %p/etc/group-fink.
	  * Install those in the 'passwd-configs' package (now an unversioned
	    dependency) so that we don't have to update passwd-core when we update
	    these files if we don't want to.
	    (Using appropriate tags in the git repo should allow this to happen.)
	  * Have update-passwd look in those scripts if %p/etc/passwd.conf is
	    set for AutoUid: false and use those values.
	  * If a user/group isn't present, fall back to manual entry.

20130103:                                                        
    * Modify "update-passwd" script to take more arguments, rather than
      deal with parsing the passwd file format of the extant %p/etc/passwd-fink
      and %p/etc/group-fink files, now that we're not catting that into niload.
      (And even if we decided to support 10.4, we could generate the appropriate 
      input format for niload from this information.)
    * Put the user/group strings into the user packages to allow the use of separate
      .info files to avoid rebuilds of everything when there's an update.
    * Modify UID/GID allocation
        * Don't overwrite entries for existing users, since we don't use the existing
          static UID/GID numbers for anything anyway.
        * Stop using 250-299 range, which is subject to use by Apple.
            * Dynamic by default
                * Use information from fink.conf, e.g. to pick up network-specific
                  settings.
                * Fall back to 600-699 range otherwise.
                * Current behavior is just to check UIDs, even when allocating
                  GIDs.
            * User override (assuming that fink isn't already set up with
                a range) via a prompt rather than editing a config file.
